JS is made up of objects (properties) and actions (methods)
each object has its own methods

var syntax
var varName = 'var value';  having the '' makes it a string
with out the '' its a literal

Array is a list
var arrayname = ['list of items seperated by ,','next item in list'];

var as numbers can be a new defined number for reuse or total of existing other var strings
notice no '' and note 3 is just my example no relevance to anything else
var nuberofothervariable =3;

boolean is true false or yes no value, notice no '' used here either refer to 5th line above for reason
var booleanname = false;

variable as object can combine all things like array
var richObject = {
	firstName:'Rich',
	lastName: "Armstrong",
	favColors: ['blue','red','green',]
	yearsAlive:103,
	isMale: true}

	So I can access all of those details using dot notation

	i.e. grab an item from the rich object would be this
	richObject.firstName the console would return rich 

Functions
like a variable can be stored in a variable or refered to from a variable
syntax
function whatIsMyFavColor () {
	}

	or 

var whatIsMyFavColor = function  () {
	}



	var doSomething = function  () {
	console.log("do Something!!!");
	}

	quotes means the console will didsplay the string but putting the parens after a function makes JS do something for example it would log do Something!!!

	Later note possibly log what photos were selected?

	so var whatIsMyFavColor = function (){

	return "what ever string I put in here"
	}

	when asked for in dot notation would return what is in the "" can return anything but anything after return doesnt actually run



	retrun the area
	var area = function (width, height) {
	return width * height;
	}

and I ask for area() JS wouldnt return anything NaN as it doesnt know what the with and height is. So I must feed it those numbers

So I want to know whats the area of a space that is 4 by 6
area(4,6) 
js would return 24

var fullName = function (firstname, secondname){
	return firstname + ' ' + secondname
}

fullName('Nacho','Cheese');
"Nacho Cheese"

Define a var
var myName ="Patrick"
undefined

Call that var and combine with string
fullName(myName,'Cheese');
"Patrick Cheese"

If Statements


Will give pop up message with male written in it
if(true) {
	//do something
	alert('male')
}


Will give pop up message with male written in it
if('male' == 'male') {
	//do something
	alert('male')
}

single = assigns a value

== actually test if something is true or false


So I can define some vars
var number1 =10;
var number2 =20;

run an if than else
	
if (number1> number2) {
	alert('true');
}else{
alert('false');}

So I can define some vars
var name1 ='Rich';
var name2 ='Bob';

if (name1 == 'Rich') {
	alert('true1');
}else if (name2 == 'Rich'){
alert('true2');
}else{
	alert('false');}
